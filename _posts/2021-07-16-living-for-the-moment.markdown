Most of us live either in future or in the past. To live in the present moment is a challenge, and does not always correlate with our perception of life. Present moment seem to fly by, even without us noticing it. Recent times have brought to sharp focus on the futility of thinking about the future. A pandemic which has devastated lives all across the globe, have made people sensitive to the uncertainty of life.  

## Scared of Losing Out
One of the perceptions that have undergone a change is that there is endless time in the world to enjoy life. The pace at which the pandemic killed exposed human fragility and helplessness. A huge number of people have realized that life may end in a moment, and are now more anxious about their future. Deferring pleasure and enjoyment to future looks like a bad choice. Everyone wants to experience pleasure here and now. Spending does not seem to be a problem as it used to be, when there is so little time to spend it. 

Refusing to give in to pressure of spending more time in offices, more and more people are seeing advantages of working from home. This way they spend more time with their families and spend less time in useless travel. More people are getting out and travelling to places they had never seen. The thought of death and separation from loved ones have made forced people to rethink their priorities and way of living.

## Changing Priorities
The future is less of a priority now, with most now living for the present. Afraid of the possibility that life may end anytime, people want to enjoy all the pleasures of life, before one's time is up. All the desires which had not seen the light of day, now rises up to be fulfilled. Nobody wants to defer the enjoyment. Even though this way of living is not new, it is now a more widespread phenomenon. The only bad side of all this that it puts an enormous stress on financial resources of the individual. 

Living out one's long held desires have now become top most priority like never before.

There is another side effect of 'Living for the Present'. Thoughtlessness becomes a norm and in the maddening rush to live out every desire, future consequences are ignored. This may not have an impact in short term, but in the long term the dwindled savings and increased fatigue leaves its scar. So what does all this mean? Are we to live a life, scared of an unpredictable life?

## Unpredictable Life
Being uncertain of what future will bring, most of us try to pretend as if it does not exist. Somehow the uncertainty justifies the stance that all desires are urgent and are to be fulfilled immediately, here and now. It is hard for most people to see that it is the long list of desires and ignorance on theirs part of life inherent unpredictability is responsible for the anxiety that they feel.  

**Life was always unpredictable**, even if we think otherwise. Just because it is possible to plan and safely predict some events, most live under the illusion that they will never be blindsided. Life can throw a curved ball at times, of which we had no idea about. When faced with such an event, most presume that life itself will end any moment. Anxious that there is little time left, desires assume an urgency which was missing earlier and mad rush begins. Is this the right way to deal with an unpredictable life, or is there a better way? 

Living in the present gives us an alternative way to deal with current uncertainties that we see all around us. 

## Giving up the Future
Giving up on future which is yet to materialize looks an easy job, but it is not. To begin with, why do even need to give up on future? For the very reason that **it has not yet materialized and we human beings are not good predictors of future to begin with**. What about all the prediction tools, artificial intelligence etc. etc.? We may have state-of-the-art technology helping us to predict, but let us keep in mind that all of it based on data collected in the past. And that's what make it fallible. Nobody knows what the future data will look like.

Why are we then so obsessed about our future. We do not know what all factors will play out, when that future of our dreams becomes our present. Essentially even when we have planned our future to the minutest detail, there will be something we miss out, something we ever thought about. Does that mean we should never plan? We could plan safely when we know something has occurred with regularity and predictions have worked in the past, but for rest it is nothing more than a wild guess. 

What does all this mean for us? It means all the worrying about the future and anxiety about our life is a load we can safely put down. Wow! Can we dump the past like that as well?   

## Giving up the Past
**Our past is a memory trail that lives on within us.** Even though it has no material existence in the present, it feels real to us. We get nostalgic seeing old places, people and things. The bad times feel as if it was just yesterday that they happened. Why does our past have got such a grip on us? Why do we often go back in time in our thoughts and get worked up or feel depressed? 

The reason that our past has such a grip on us is because it is our foundation. Our sense of self is built upon our memories. And when we are asked to let it go, it seems to an arduous task. It is not easy to get rid of our past like it is with our future. What we are now has reflections of past all over it. Then how can we do away with all the excess baggage?

By doing what we do when we go a trip, and we do not have anyone to carry our weight for us. Retain the essentials and dump the rest. Keep your loving relations(friends and family) from the past and lessons learned. That's just about it. What you don't need is self-denigrating memories of the past humiliations, let-downs and broken relationships. You can keep memories of 'once in a lifetime' events as a bonus. 

## Living in the Present
Now that we have taken out future and past from our lives, what else remains? Yes, the present moment. And when you see that there is nothing else you will ever be in, and we understand our constraints the urgency drops. There is nowhere to go, nothing to hide or run away from. We can only do so much, given our constraints. Whatever there ever will be is right before us. If we can give the moment whatever we got, and face whatever it may bring to us, all our worries and fears vanish. We know we may die and anything can end any moment, but until that happens we live with no worries and regret.

We must **'Live in the Present'**, not 'Live for the Present'.
