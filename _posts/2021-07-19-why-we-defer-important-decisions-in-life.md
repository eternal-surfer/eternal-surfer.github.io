Most of us have been in situations where we need to take an important action or make an important decision, and in the last moment we defer. Why do we do defer important decisions in life? Is the decision we need to make and the action we need to take are not important anymore?  

## Our Value System
When we say something is important for our life, how do we know it is important? 

Our past, age, environment, life experiences, people in our lives and education shape our values. We may not be aware of it, but our value system determines what we think is important for our lives. It may not always be the best we can do with our lives, but still we consider them important as they align with what we have come to value.

**Most of us have a self-image shaped by what others have come to expect of us.** Our interaction with society, parents, friends and peers influence us in such a way that we come to value what they value. We value what others value as our own and remain in dark about what is it that we personally value. In short, our value system is a mix of our personal values and values we adopt from other people.

## What is Important?
Now why is it important to know what 'important' mean to us? Looking at what we consider important in our lives, we gain a glimpse into our value system.

**Once you know about your values, it becomes easier to make decisions and take action, and we stick better with our plans.** Without a clear sense of our values, we linger in indecision. Decisions made are mostly forced ones, where we believe we don't have any option. Decisions are taken by society, parents, partner or your boss. 'Reward' or 'Punishment' which we expect to get, decides how we act.

Suppose you are in a job which you strongly dislike. And you need the job just because you need to pay your bills. What will other people say if you leave it? You want to pursue some other work, but you are afraid that it will not pay as good as your current job. Leaving the job is not an option. **Survival fears keep us from making important changes in our life, we keep deferring important decisions to future.** 

## Why we defer important decisions?
There can be many reasons for why we defer important decisions. Some of usual ones are

- **Fear of Humiliation** : Many times fear of loosing face in front of others makes us choose options, which are bad for us as individuals. We keep doing things we don't like, just to avoid humiliation. Fear of humiliation is also one of major reason for anxiety in our lives.  

- **Fear of Failure** : Failure for many of us is a deterrent enough to avoid taking the first steps to break out of our present situation and starting on a new path.  
  
- **Unfamiliarity** : Unfamiliarity with the new environment and the work required for gaining knowledge about the unknown is another reason to defer important decisions. Getting out of the comfort zone of a familiar territory is difficult, if not impossible for most people. 
  
- **Lack of Resources** : This is one of the most frequently given reasons to defer important decisions. It might be that there is shortage of financial resources to fund the new venture. Lack of a backup income stream is a compelling reason not to get out of the current situation.
 
- **Learning Difficulties** : Even though learning difficulty is an unusual reason, this is in fact the most ignored and important factor on why don't even start or just give up early. When you go deeper into the previous reasons, we come to know that main underlying root cause is lack of knowledge. Not knowing how to go about doing something, sets one up for sure failure. Repeated failures end up as lifelong fear. Any decision or work which might end up in failure, is avoided and deferred to later time.

There can be many individual reasons for not starting out on an important venture of one's life, but most of them boil down to reasons we discussed so far.

## Learning Curve
Of all the reasons above, one reason stands out. **'Learning Difficulties' may not be the most obvious reason, but it underlies every other one.**

A steep learning curve and continued frustration with being not able to understand how to overcome blocks to our progress, act as strong demotivators. Perseverance in face of unsurmountable learning challenge is difficult, if not impossible. Most give up, never to return. Boredom and lack of interest may be given as a reason, but if you dig deeply you can easily see that it is the lack of being able to learn which is underlies the more superficial reason.

**Steep learning curve is a strong demotivator, specially when the rewards are not immediately known or attainable, and punishment is imminent.**

When we repeat mistakes, we basically do it either because of not understanding the consequences or due to lack of knowledge. Not able to understand how to deal with what is in front of us, we give in to usual distractions. Distractions lie television, smartphones, internet, social media are easy to cope with and easy to use and understand. 

Once we are used to the habit of using distractions as way out of learning difficulties, it is difficult to go back. Deferring important decisions become a hard to break habit.

Instead of giving in to distraction, we can do something which breaks the pattern of indecision and puts us on a path of progress.

## Getting Help
**Most of us don't realize that when we run into difficulties, we are in need of support and help. We need someone to guide and mentor us.** Sometimes we need a teacher to tell us what we want to learn in a simpler way or guide us to new ways to deal and cope. We need someone to motivate us.

Then why don't we reach out for help? Sometimes the help we need can be as obvious as getting a loan, but we don't reach out for help.

**We all can do a lot better with some help from others.**
  
When we believe that we have to make important decisions in our life all alone, that is when we truly fail. Life passes by, and we keep making plans that remain a fantasy. We fear the unknown because we are unsure we can deal with it. To ask for help when need might be a humiliating experience, but it just might be what we need to make your dreams come true.
