What's the latest? What's New? Are these not one of the most heard of questions? Novelty seekers are all around us, chasing the latest. Be it the latest car, smartphone, fashion accessory, games or videos the list goes on. We have all become slaves to the novelty in our life. Even if we lack the resources to buy all the latest, most of us desire to make the buy as soon as next paycheck comes in. 

## The Attraction of the 'New'
Why does novelty attract us so much? It does have a purpose. As living things, we are always concerned about our survival. Survival needs that we have to always be on lookout for new resources and to keep ourselves safe. The purpose looks so simple that we have a hard time believing it. We think either it is our boredom that forces us to look for novelty, or it is social need to keep ourselves updated. 

Some of us take it to very different level. Novelty seeking turns into an obsession. To possess the latest has such a strong symbolic meaning in our social life that most of us would not miss for anything. Many people have fallen into debt traps just for keeping up the image.

Novelty seeking which for us have a very real purpose, have now taken a new meaning. It is no longer understood as a tool to find new resources or detect danger. It has now become a weakness which is targeted for making money. A whole industry of advertising exists just for the purpose.
