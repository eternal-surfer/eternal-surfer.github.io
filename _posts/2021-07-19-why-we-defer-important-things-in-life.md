Most of us have been in situations where we need to take an important action or make an important decision, and in the last moment we defer. Why do we do it? Is the action we need to take or decision we need to make not important anymore?  

## Our Value System
When we say something is important for our life, mostly it is guided by our value systems. Our past, age, environment, life experiences, people in our lives and education contribute a lot to shape our values. We may not be aware of all of it, but our value system determines what we think is important for our lives. It may not always be the best we can do with our lives, but still we consider them important as they align with what we know and have come to value.

Society, parents, friends and peers exert a great influence on most of us. **Most of us have a self-image shaped by what others have come to expect of us.** We value what others value as our own and remain in dark about what is it that we ourselves value. 

## What is Important?
Now why is it important to know what 'important' mean to us? To understand what is important to us, is to gain a glimpse into our value system. **Once you know about your values, it becomes easier to make decisions and take action, and we stick better with our plans.** Until then most of our decisions are not truly made by us, and action we take in under the influence of reward or punishment we expect to get from others. That 'other' may be society, parents, partner or your boss, but it is they who make decisions for you.

**Most of the time what we think is important for us gets done, what is truly important for us gets deferred.** Let me explain what that means. Suppose you are in a job which you strongly dislike. And you need the job just because you need to pay your bills. What will other people say if you leave it? You want to pursue some other work, but you are afraid that it will not pay as good as your current job. Leaving the job is not an option. You see how, what we think is important gets done. And what is truly important for us gets deferred.

## Why we defer important decisions?
There can be many reasons given for why we defer important things. Some of them are

- **Fear of failure** : Failure for many of us is a deterrent enough to avoid taking the first steps to break out of our present situation and starting a new venture.  
  
- **Unfamiliarity** : Unfamiliarity with the new environment and the efforts required for gaining knowledge about the unfamiliar field is another reason we usually defer important things. Getting out of the comfort zone of a familiar territory is difficult, if not impossible for most. 
  
- **Lack of resources** : This might be one of the most frequently given reasons to defer important decisions. It might be that there is shortage of financial resources to fund the new venture. Lack of a backup income stream is a compelling reason not to get out of the current situation.
 
- **Learning difficulties** : Even though learning difficulty does not come up as a reason, this is in fact the most ignored and important factor on why don't even start or just give up early. When you go deeper into the previous reasons, we come to know that main underlying root cause is lack of knowledge. Not knowing how to go about doing something, sets one up for sure failure. Repeated failures end up as lifelong fear. Any decision or work which might end up in failure, is avoided and deferred to later time.

There can be many individual reasons for not starting out on an important venture of one's life, but most of them boil down to reasons we discussed so far.

## Learning Curve
As we have seen learning difficulty is one of the reasons we defer important decisions and actions, even if not the most obvious. A steep learning curve and continued frustration with being not able to understand how to succeed in some aspect of the work, is strong discouragement. Perseverance in face of unsurmountable learning challenge is difficult, if not impossible. Most give up, never to return. Boredom and lack of interest may be given as a reason, but if you dig deeply you can easily see that it is the lack of being able to learn which is underlies the more superficial reason.

**Steep learning curve is a strong demotivator when doing any work, especially so when the rewards are not immediately known or attainable.**

When we repeat mistakes, we basically do it either because of not understanding the consequences or due to lack of knowledge. Not able to understand how to deal with what is in front of us, we give in to usual distractions. Television, smartphones, internet, social media, binge-watching videos etc. are easy, something we understand. Once we are used to this pattern of using any of these as way out of learning difficulties, it is difficult to go back. Deferring important things become a hard to break habit. 

## Getting Help
**Most of us don't realize that when we run into difficulties, we are in need of support and help. We need someone to guide and mentor us.** Sometimes we need a teacher to tell us what we want to learn in a simpler way or guide us to new ways to deal and cope. Why we don't reach out for help. Sometimes the help can be as obvious as getting a loan, but all of us need help sometimes.

**We all can do a lot better with some help from others.**
  
When we believe that we have to deal with important things in our life all alone, that is when we truly fail to take the first steps. Life passes by, and we only keep making fantastic plans that remain unfulfilled. We fear the unknown just because we are unsure whether we would have the knowledge to deal with it. To ask for help when need might be a humiliating experience, but it just might be what you need if you want to make your dreams come true.
