Life as we know it now, has become stressful in recent times and continues to become more stressful with each passing day. How many times have we stopped and given a thought on why we do, what we do? And what is it that we want to achieve with all this striving? Why do we complicate our life so much, to live like a fly stuck in a spider web?

## Eternal Pursuit

All of us are on an endless pursuit, whether we are consciously aware of it or not. Minute we think it is all over, something comes up which yet again needs all our attention. We all have a justification for whatever it is that we are doing now. On deeper reflection though, all these justification and reasons come apart like threads from a torn piece of cloth. Are we trying to lie to ourselves that our life has a meaning and that it justifies all that we face on daily, day in night out.  

A better life for ourselves and our family, a desire for everlasting legacy, a desire to bask in glory comes up as some usual justifications. In search of the everlasting happiness, we spend our days toiling away. Whatever time remains is lived worrying about the what's missing in our lives. Happiness that we manage to squeeze out of life, comes and goes before we even have the time to enjoy it fully.

Are we here to enjoy the pleasures of life?

## Pursuit of Pleasure
Pursuit of pleasure is a tricky business. Pleasure derived from material things is short-lived. If other people are the source of our happiness, we run the risk of it being taken away any time. Envy and jealousy makes sure that happiness turns into pain within no time.  

When we have what we think would give us happiness, it no longer feels so good. Familiarity brings with it a certain indifference and contempt. Excitement we get when we reach our goals or when we get what we always wished for, vanishes in matter of days, and sometimes in an instant. Soon we are on another pursuit, a new goal chase. Our lives become a big pursuit, a never ending chase which does not seem to have any end in sight.  

Why do we toil so much, to what end? If survival had been the reason, we would have stopped once we had enough to survive. If we were after happiness, we would only do those activities that gives us happiness. Had the reason been money, why do we still go on when we have money more than we could possibly spend in a lifetime. When not doing anything, even then we feel empty and bored. We feel dismal in midst of all the luxuries of the world. This means pursuit of pleasure is not the answer we are looking for. Why do we feel so empty in our lives? 

## The Emptiness

Emptiness we feel in our lives is so subtle in nature that most times we fail to pay attention when it strikes. We are driven to fill this emptiness as fast as possible, at any cost to our happiness and stability. We think all the sorrow in our lives is all our own fault. Not surprisingly, there are many businesses out there, who take advantage of this need and make billions doing so. This mad frenzy to fill our emptiness makes us do things we don't like and take risks we should have avoided.  

We want to run as far away as possible from this gnawing feeling of emptiness, even when it means destruction and injury for ourselves and our loved ones. 

The feeling of emptiness along with the belief that we are not good enough and have not yet achieved enough, keeps us going. We always want more and more and get frustrated, if things don't come easy. Any advice to keep patience sounds cruel, as the wait seems to just prolong our suffering but not end it. We want everything now, as it would mean that we are good enough at last. Any time we hear that we are less than others in any way, it brings the emptiness back. We hate to believe what we had done till now is a waste.  

Then how are we to deal with this endless feeling of emptiness? Another pursuit looks alluring. But can it solve all our problems? Are we not just trying to fill up the emptiness, without even understanding why we need to do it?

## How we deal with emptiness?

The reason we get so scared by emptiness, is that it brings us face to face with our own vulnerability. When not engaged in any work, we ruminate about our shortcomings and past failures. All this self reflection most of the time, delivers a blow to our fragile ego. A teenager playing video games, or a businessman working 70 hour week, may look to have very different motives for what they are doing. But it is not, both are trying to avoid the emptiness for different worldly reasons.  

Although failures and shortcomings are part of everyone's life, it is surprising that many of us do not readily accept it. When we see others and start to compare ourselves with them, we always focus on their achievements and fail to see their failings and the cost and effort behind the success. Our failings look inexcusable, we think we deserve our suffering. Magically when we are involved in anything, we forget about our selves and our failings. Emptiness is all behind us, we have somehow been able to move away from it. And this makes us believe that being engaged in something is the antidote for the venomous emptiness.  

If emptiness is experienced for what it is, that is complete *emptiness*, we would not so frantically avoid it. But this is not the case with most of us, and we end up filling the emptiness with thoughts that eat away at our sense of well-being. Our minds are not empty even in our *emptiness*.  

We think we know everything about ourselves, which we in fact don't. Why then are we uncomfortable when we are all alone, and don't have anything to do? Why do we scramble to find something to do? When we are idle, our mind with a clear bias for problems and lack, go on and on, munching on the same old problems repeatedly. It never stops. If we are not thinking about our past, we are either making plans for future or fantasizing about it. With such a disdain for emptiness, how can we then put an end to all this never ending pursuit, an obsessive need to get away from emptiness?   

## Ending all pursuit
Is it possible to end all pursuits? Well the answer can be a 'Yes' as well as a 'No'. We cannot end all pursuit as we have to go on with our lives till we die. We would still have goals to achieve, if not for ourselves then for our children, our families. So there is no way to end all pursuits. There is still a way to lessen the suffering though, which may sound easy but is hard in practice. 

**The trick is to give up all chasing and enjoy the ride.** It is like getting out of driver's seat and spreading yourself on the back seat. You may be wondering how is this possible? Who is driving then, and what about all the goals and responsibilities? Is it not gravely immature on our part to give up on progress, and watch our lives go by? 

Let me describe a bit more by what is meant by getting on the back seat. What we all do is try our best to control our life. Instead of doing that, we have to let our life guide us and take us where are meant to be. This means giving up on our expectations. What? Giving up on expectations. Yes, we have to change how we see life through our rose colored glasses tinted by our expectations and prejudices.  

Our *Life* or whatever you like to call it, constantly give us clues on what we have to do at any given time. When we stubbornly hold onto our expectations, we suffer. Sometimes it takes a whole lifetime to understand that we were barking up the wrong tree. Instead of pushing on to reach our ambitions we have to listen, listen to what life is asking us to do. We must leave the driver seat and take the back seat. Life may be asking us to change, or it may just be throwing up evidences that we are wrong in our assumptions. Whatever it is, life is guiding us in subtle ways, so that we may give up the chase and start living. If we get comfortable with the emptiness and stop running away from it, we can even end all pursuit and beat boredom in one shot.

Giving up the chase does not mean we live a vegetative life. It means that we live a meaningful life, one that is guided by life itself, and one that makes sense to us.

## The Goldmine
What we get out of giving up control and let life guide us? If you think that a stop to incessant worrying and planning about the future and getting out of the grip of our dismal past are good enough rewards, then the goldmine of a fulfilling life is for your taking. Emptiness is no more an enemy then, but a lifelong friend.
